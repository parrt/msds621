The simplest and most common approach is to create an overall vocabulary, $V$, created as a set of unique words across all documents in all classes. *Sort the unique words in the vocab alphabetically so we standardize which word is associated with which word vector index.* Then, the training features are those words."

All you have to do is put the [test.yml](https://github.com/parrt/msds621/blob/master/projects/bayes/test.yml) file I have prepared for you into repo subdirectory `.github/workflows`, commit, and push back to github. Then go to the Actions tab of your repository and you'll see something like this:\n",

Once you have something basic working, this functionality is very nice because it automatically shows you how your software is going to run on a different computer (a linux computer). This will catch the usual errors where you have hardcoded something from your machine into the software. It also gets you in the habit of committing software to the repository as you develop it, rather than using the repository as a homework submission device.\n",
